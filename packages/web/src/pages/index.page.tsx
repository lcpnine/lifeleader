          What is a Mandala Chart?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">

          aiding in comprehensive planning and execution.

          Structure of a Mandala Chart

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Mandala Chart is visually represented as a large square divided
          into nine smaller squares. The central square encapsulates the primary
          goal or theme, while the eight surrounding squares represent related
          sub-goals or aspects, offering a holistic perspective.

          Begin by placing your central goal in the middle square. Surround it
          with eight related elements, each representing a sub-goal or aspect.

          detailed roadmap for your objective.
